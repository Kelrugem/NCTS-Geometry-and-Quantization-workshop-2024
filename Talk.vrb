\frametitle{A quick funny example, again by $\mathbb {S}^7$}
\begin{example}\vspace{.5pt}
The Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ given as the pair groupoid of $\mathbb{S}^7$ leads to descriptions of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs theories, which cannot be described in an ordinary way due to the lack of non-associativity on $\mathbb{S}^7$.
\end{example}
